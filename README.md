### **Project Description**

This project is a comprehensive educational platform designed to digitise the traditional classroom experience by streamlining homework management, note-taking, and learning content delivery. It empowers teachers to create, publish, and grade structured assignments while enabling students to submit and track their work through an intuitive interface. The platform includes a split-screen textbook viewer, rich note editor, and real-time feedback mechanisms to enhance study efficiency. Additionally, it aims to expand into a Udemy-like module, allowing expert educators to upload courses and create interactive exercises that deepen subject understanding. Ultimately, the platform addresses core challenges in education—such as paper dependency, limited teacher reach, and fragmented learning tools—by offering a unified, scalable, and learner-centered solution.
